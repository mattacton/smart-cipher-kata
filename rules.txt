------------------------Cipher Crypto Kata-------------------------------------
Caesar has nothing on this Crypto Cipher used by secret agents the 
world over(by this I mean no one uses it). Currently this cipher is
used by hand to convert covert messages into an unreadable message. 
We need to make it automatic to encrypt the message and mostly
automatic to decrypt the message. Decrypting will still take some
human thinking, but we can get mostly there.

When finished, your program should be able to follow all of the below
rules and be able to turn:
"the eagle has left the bananas in the nest"
into unreadable text following the rules and then back into:
"th[] [][]gl[] h[]s l[]ft th[] b[]n[]n[]s []n th[] n[]st"

Below you will find the rules of the cipher and substitution letters. 

Letter substitutions:
Normal Letter ==> Cipher Letter

d ==> p
s ==> d
t ==> b
m ==> i
l ==> q
y ==> g
c ==> f
n ==> h
p ==> j
r ==> k
k ==> l
h ==> t
z ==> y
b ==> r
g ==> a
f ==> o
q ==> m
j ==> v
v ==> e
w ==> x
x ==> u

Cipher Rules
1. Consonants can be translated via the table above.
2. Vowels are not translated to another letter
  a. A vowel will be noted by the letter immediately preceeding or following 
      the vowel.
  b. In the encrypted text, the vowel will be noted by two repeating letters
      where one letter is upper case and the other is lower case.
  c. E.G. Take the word "hall". The vowel could be replaced in the following
      two ways:
    1. "Hhll"
    2. "hlLl"
  d. two or more vowels next to each other can be noted as follows in the
      word "beagle"
    1. "?BbgLl" The ? denotes more than one vowel.
    2. "BbgGLl"
  e. Words with no consonants will be translated to one pair of [] per letter.
3. Repeating consonants can be noted most of the time by the use of capital 
      letters as shown below.
    a. The word "butter" could be transformed into "BbTrR" The capital T
      denotes 2 t's.
    b. You may run into the scenario where you need double letters and a
      vowel. You can note the situation as follows in the word "booggle":
      1. "bg?G?Ll" The ? between the letter G denotes that there are 2 or
        more G's following the 2 or more vowels. The trailing ? is once
        again noting that there is 2 or more vowels preceeding the G.
    c. More than 2 repeating consonants can be noted with a ?.
      1. In the word "mittthrow" can be noted as "MmT?hrwW"
